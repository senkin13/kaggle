# Kaggle - Open Problems - Multimodal Single Cell Integration - 2nd Place Solution




This repository is the 2nd place solutions for the  [Kaggle - Open Problems - Multimodal Single-Cell Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal).  

It contains  two parts from [senkin13](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal/discussion/366453) and [tmp](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal/discussion/366476) .

### OVERVIEW

This pipeline mainly consists of the following parts:

 - Preprocessing
 - FE
 - Modeling

This simple solution produced a quite robust result (Public_lb 1st; Private_lb 2nd).

### Preprocessing

- using raw count:

- normalization:

- transformation:

- standardization:

- batch-effect correction:


### Feature engineering

- decomposition

  - pca (64)
  - ipca (128)
  - factor analysis (64)

- features selection

  -  Features highly correlated with target are selected. 245 features are selected in total.

- cell-type (one-hot)


### Modelling

both mlp and lgb used the same features introduced above.

- mlp (simple mlp performs best  (single model with 1 seed - public 0.815; private 0.772))

- lgb

  

### Local CV

- random 5-fold cv
- split according to "day"
